Main structure with 4 folders from *second brain*.
```
- 1 Projects
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
```

Folders in *Projects* are always numbered starting with 100 and increasing.
If you start a new project, add the next number and name of the project.
```
- 1 Projects
    - 100 duohausdhs
    - 101 sdoihasu<odh
    - 102 sdhasudhaus
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
```

Folders in *Areas* and *Resources* don't need to be numbered.
Some or all may be numbered to "pin" them on the top.
```
- 1 Projects
- 2 Areas
    - 200 duohausdhs
    - 201 sdoihasu<odh
    - 202 sdhasudhaus
    - asuhausidhsau
    - buoadshsuai
    - cauiasuj
    - saydhasudh
- 3 Resources
    - 300 duohausdhs
    - 301 sdoihasu<odh
    - 302 sdhasudhaus
    - asuhausidhsau
    - buoadshsuai
    - cauiasuj
    - saydhasudh
- 4 Archive
```

Folder numbering is free in *Archive*.
Probably a good idea to at least remove the number to avoid confusion.
E.g. project *117 Lorem Ipsum* is complete, you rename it to *Lorem Ipsum* and move it  to archive.

Before:
```
- 1 Projects
    - ...
    - 117 Lorem Ipsum
    - ...
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
    - ...
```

After:
```
- 1 Projects
    - ...
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
    - ...
    - Lorem Ipsum
    - ...
```

Additional level of numbering can be included *Jonny Decimal* style for numbered folders.
