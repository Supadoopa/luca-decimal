## Main structure

Main structure with 4 folders from *second brain*.
```
- 1 Projects
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
```

## Folder structure in *1 Projects*

Folders in *Projects* are always numbered starting with 100 and increasing.
If you start a new project, add the next number and name of the project.
```
- 1 Projects
    - 100 duohausdhs
    - 101 sdoihasu<odh
    - 102 sdhasudhaus
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
```

## Folder structure in *2 Areas* and *3 Resources*

Folders in *Areas* and *Resources* don't need to be numbered.
Some or all may be numbered to "pin" them on the top.
```
- 1 Projects
- 2 Areas
    - 200 duohausdhs
    - 201 sdoihasu<odh
    - 202 sdhasudhaus
    - asuhausidhsau
    - buoadshsuai
    - cauiasuj
    - saydhasudh
- 3 Resources
    - 300 duohausdhs
    - 301 sdoihasu<odh
    - 302 sdhasudhaus
    - asuhausidhsau
    - buoadshsuai
    - cauiasuj
    - saydhasudh
- 4 Archive
```

## Folder structure in *4 Archive*

Folder numbering is free in *Archive*.
Probably a good idea to at least remove the number to avoid confusion.
E.g. project *117 Lorem Ipsum* is complete, you rename it to *Lorem Ipsum* and move it  to archive.

Before:
```
- 1 Projects
    - ...
    - 117 Lorem Ipsum
    - ...
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
    - ...
```

After:
```
- 1 Projects
    - ...
- 2 Areas
- 3 Resources
- 4 Archive
    - ...
    - Lorem Ipsum
    - ...
```

## Subfolders numbering

Additional level of numbering can be included *Jonny Decimal* style for numbered folders.
```
- 1 Projects
    - ...
- 2 Areas
    - ...
    - 221 sdhasudhaus
        - 202.01 idasuhd
        - 202.02 eujasidj
        - 202.03 dihasudha
    - ...
- 3 Resources
    - ...
    - 312 sdhasudhaus
        - 312.01 aoishad
        - 312.02 adhqoisjdwai
        - 312.03 asidhasudh
    - ...
- 4 Archive
    - ...
```

## Consistency among different apps

Consistency among systems.
All programs should follow the same structure.
- Local files.
- Note taking apps.
- Todo-apps

It doesn't need to be replicated everywhere all the time, but if anything related is across multiple programs it must stay consistent.
Example:
> You have an folder in *2 Areas* called *201 Health*, where you save the pdfs of your exams.
> You don't need *Health* in your note taking and todo apps right away.
> If you add a reminder in your todo-app for a yearly check-up, then you should also name it *Health*.
> If you add a note of the opening times of your doctor, it also must end up in a folder called *Health*.
